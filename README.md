# Static Site Generator

The task is to write your own version of a static site generator, just like Jekyll (Ruby) or
Pelican (Python). Basically, to create static web pages from markdown.
You should do two pages. The home page where there is a list of articles and the article
page where you go after click on the title of the article from the home page.
